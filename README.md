### Start app and file server

You can start the app for the phone book creation with

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

and the file server with

```bash
npm run server:file
```

**Best way to run**
The best way to start both, app and file server, is to use pm2. In this repository is a predefined configuraion file.

1. install pm2 global

```bash
sudo npm install -location=global pm2
```

2. start the app and file server

```bash
pm2 start pm2.config.js
```

3. Starting PM2 on Boot

```bash
pm2 startup
pm2 start pm2.config.js
pm2 save
```

With the following command you can see the status of the apps

```bash
pm2 status pm2.config.js
```

and if you are a _nerd_ use this command ;)

```bash
pm2 monit
```

### access Remote phone books

The File server will be avaiable under the port 8080, so you can open the url for example http://localhost:8080 in your browser. Now you should see all defined phone books.

Last step is to config you IP Phones with the remote phone books.
